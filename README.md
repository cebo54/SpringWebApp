## Social Media Platform
This repository contains a social media platform developed using Spring Boot for the backend, React for the frontend, MySQL for the database, and JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication. The platform was developed over a period from August 2023 to September 2023.

## Project Overview
This social media platform allows users to create posts, like posts, and comment on posts. All interactions are securely stored in a MySQL database, and user authentication is managed through JWT to ensure that only registered users can access the platform's features.

## Key Features
### User Authentication:

Users must register with a username and password.
Authentication is managed via JWT, ensuring secure access to the platform.
### Posts:

Users can create posts that are visible to other users on the platform.
Each post is recorded in the database and can be interacted with by other users.
### Likes:

Users can like posts.
The like action is recorded in the database, and the number of likes is visible to all users.
### Comments:

Users can comment on posts.
Comments are recorded in the database, and all users can view the comments on each post.
### Database Integration:

All data, including users, posts, likes, and comments, is stored in a MySQL database.
The database is designed to efficiently handle the relationships between users, posts, likes, and comments.
